# Blackberry Inventory Library

Written in Java for developing applications on Blackberry, the library is designed to gather both software and hardware information.

## 1. Information collected

The Blackberry Inventory Library collects several specifications of the categories in order to create a complete Inventory of the Blackberry devices.

## 2. Export the inventory

The Library supports the generation of XML and JSON files with the content of the inventory as they are the main data-interchange formats.
