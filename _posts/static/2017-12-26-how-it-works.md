The Blackberry Inventory Library helps you to create a complete inventory of your Blackberry device: both hardware and software informations are collected. You get the data about battery, memory, networks, etc., in a beautiful XML as protocol compatible with Fusion Inventory for GLPI.

This Library was created from the Fusion Inventory Agent following the [Inventory Protocol](http://fusioninventory.org/documentation/dev/spec/protocol/inventory.html "Click here to learn more").
